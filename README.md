# FuzzyInferenceSystemFromGBT
This repository contains the implementation of a methodology that transforms CatBoost gradient boosting ensembles into fully interpretable fuzzy inference systems. The approach emphasizes linguistic term generation through adaptive cutpoint optimization strategies, while maintaining complete transparency in credit risk assessment.
